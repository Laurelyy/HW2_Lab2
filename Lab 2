#In the fine arts sector, 37 females and 20 males were affected by COVID.

#I would like to look into why Hispanic females were disproportionately affected in both sectors.

#That said, I'd like to hypothesize that a majority of women who were affected by COVID in these sectors where affected the lack of childcare. I'd also like to see what proportion of men also shared this burden.

#To start, I would like to look at the proportion of negatively affected individuals of both genders working that have at least 1 child and whose martial status is one of the following: 	Married(spouse absent),	Separated, Widowed, Divorced or Never married/single

#I'll start by creating a new variable for women and men affected by COVID, with degrees in Fine Arts or Business, who have at least 1 child and who is not together with their spouse or partner.

length(which(Affected_Parent_Female_Bus==0))
#All of the Hispanic females and males working within the business sector and that were affected by COVID had a marital status in which they were without spousal or partner support while also raising at least 1 child.

Affected_Parent_Female_FineA <- Affected_FineA_His_Female [ (acs2017_ny$MARST == 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 & acs2017_ny$NCHILD >= 1)]
length(which(Affected_Parent_Female_FineA==1))
length(which(Affected_Parent_Female_FineA==0))
#All of the Hispanic females and males working within the fine arts sector and that were affected by COVID had a marital status in which they were without spousal or partner support while also raising at least 1 child.


#Because it seems that both the men and women in these sectors had at least one child and were separated from their spouse or partner in some capacity; I cannot deduce that the cause of the disproportionate effect on women in these industries was influenced solely by issues concerning to childcare.
